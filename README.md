# Exploratory Data Analysis
In statistics, **exploratory data analysis** is an approach of analyzing data sets
to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and
other data visualization methods.

John Tukey definition of data analysis:
> Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such
procedures, ways of planning and gathering data to make its analysis easier,
more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of statistics
which apply to analyzing data

- An **insight** an understanding of relationships that sheds light on or helps solve
a problem.
- A **dataset** is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a dataset
corresponds to one or more tables, where every column of a table represents a
particular variable, each row corresponds to a given record of the dataset in
question.


## Objectives of EDA
- Suggest hypothesis about the causes of observed phenomena
- Asses assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
- Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
- Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments


## Types of exploratory data analysis
- Univariate non-graphical
- Univariate graphical
- Multivariate non-graphical
- Multivariate graphical


## Exploratory data analysis tools
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (I.E. Principal Component Analysis)
- Univariate visualizations
- Bivariate visualizations
- Summary statistics
- Multivariate visualizations
- Stem and leaf plots
- Histograms
